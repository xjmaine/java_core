/**
 * This is a self-test based on

/**
 * As we saw in the examples, we used the ‘/’ to work out the division of var1
 * by var2. Given that ‘+’ would perform addition, ‘-‘ subtraction and ‘*’
 * multiplication, write out a program which performs all thenamed operations by
 * using two integer values which are hard coded into the program. Hints:  You
 * need only two variables of type integer  Make one variable larger and
 * divisible by the other  You can perform the required calculations directly
 * in the print statements, remember to enclose the operation within brackets,
 * e.g. (var1-var2)
